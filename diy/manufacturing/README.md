# Manufacturing Simulation Exercise

This exercise challenges you to build a deterministic manufacturing and quality control simulation in C#, based on the provided specification (`specs.md`). The goal is to leverage GitHub Copilot as an AI pair programmer—using effective prompts to accelerate solution development.

## Getting Started

As an experienced software engineer, your task is to use Copilot to help design and implement a solution for the manufacturing simulation. Instead of following a step-by-step prompt ladder, you will create your own prompts, referencing the specification as needed.

### Meta Prompt

"I am an experienced software engineer and would like an overview of how GitHub Copilot can help me efficiently deliver a solution for the specification.
- Explain how Copilot can assist with design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance for this project.
- Highlight Copilot’s strengths in accelerating code generation, refactoring, and test creation, given that planning and requirements analysis are already established."

Use this prompt to explore Copilot’s capabilities and begin your solution. **When prompting Copilot, include the contents of `specs.md` in your context to ensure accurate and relevant responses.**

**Tip:** Break down the specification into smaller tasks and prompt Copilot for code, explanations, refactoring, and test generation as you progress.
