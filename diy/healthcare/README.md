# Healthcare Mini-Normalizer Challenge

This exercise is designed for experienced C# engineers to leverage GitHub Copilot in building a focused healthcare data normalizer, based on the provided specification (`specs.md`). Instead of step-by-step instructions, you are encouraged to use effective prompting strategies with Copilot to drive your solution.

## Getting Started

**Instructions:**
- Review the specification in `specs.md`.
- Use Copilot to generate code, tests, and documentation by crafting effective prompts.
- Focus on normalization, validation, mapping, masking, and metrics as described.


** Prompt:**

"I am an experienced C# engineer. Based on the provided healthcare normalizer specification, outline how GitHub Copilot can accelerate each phase of building this solution. For each SDLC phase (Design, Implementation, Testing, Documentation), describe specific ways Copilot can assist.:

- Give concrete examples of how Copilot can help, focusing on rapid prototyping, layered validation, terminology mapping, privacy masking, metrics tracking, and lean test generation.
- Suggest prompt strategies for generating POCOs, interfaces, validators, mappers, orchestrators, and tests directly from the spec.
- Highlight Copilot's strengths in iterative code refinement, spec-driven development, and documentation.
- Recommend best practices for leveraging Copilot to meet the acceptance criteria efficiently."
